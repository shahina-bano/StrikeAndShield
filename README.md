# StrikeAndShield
Presenting an avid COVID Shooter, a saviour from this dreadful virus.
Bullets are fired from the shooter when we click spacebar and hence kills the virus.
Many virus shaped objects move in the direction of shooter. If the shooter
successfully shoots all the viruses, player wins, however if the virus comes in
contact with our shooter before being shot, player loses.
There is a side bar which shows the score of the shooter till the time he kills the
viruses, and some keys which are referred as the movement keys for the shooter in
different directions. Header files like time.h has been used to maintain the time
gaps for viruses to move.
